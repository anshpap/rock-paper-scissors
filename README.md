### Notes:

* Works best on Chrome and Safari.
* Has some rendering issues on Firefox. I suspect this might be due to my naive understanding of async functions. I'll try to fix this when I learn more about DOM manipulation and async functions.
* I originally intended to make a more basic version without the animations. But during the development process I learned that I could make simple animations using the CSS transform property, so I decided implement them.
